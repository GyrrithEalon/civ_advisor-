Haste makes waste
Curiosity killed the cat
Better late than never
Prevention is better than cure
Better safe than sorry
Time is money
Laughter is the best medicine
To err is human; to forgive, divine
It's no use crying over spilt milk
When in Rome, do as the Romans do
Every cloud has a silver lining
You have to crack a few eggs to make an omelet
Opportunity knocks but once
Familiarity breeds contempt
Seeing is believing
Patience is a virtue
Good things come to those who wait
You catch more flies with honey than with vinegar
Still waters run deep
No man is an island
The squeaky wheel gets the grease
Don't bite the hand that feeds you
Great minds think alike
The pen is mightier than the sword
A stitch in time saves nine
Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater
Slow and steady wins the race
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder
A penny saved is a penny earned
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
Don't count your chickens before they hatch
The best things in life are free
Where there's smoke, there's fire
One man's trash is another man's treasure
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer
Money doesn't grow on trees
Give someone an inch and they'll take a mile
Actions speak louder than words
All's well that ends well
Absence sharpens love, presence strengthens it
It's better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all
If it ain't broke, don't fix it
An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure
You can't teach an old dog new tricks
Two heads are better than one
Necessity is the mother of invention
Beggars can't be choosers
Opportunity seldom knocks twice
Strike while the iron is hot
You can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs
A watched pot never boils
You can't judge a book by its cover
Look before you leap
A rolling stone gathers no moss
Easy come, easy go
Out of the frying pan and into the fire
Make hay while the sun shines
Practice makes perfect
Honesty is the best policy
A problem shared is a problem halved
A fool and his money are soon parted
If you can't beat them, join them
Pride comes before a fall
Discretion is the better part of valor
When the cat's away, the mice will play
Knowledge is power
Time heals all wounds
Variety is the spice of life
Misery loves company
Old habits die hard
Don't put all your eggs in one basket
Jack of all trades, master of none
It's the early worm that gets eaten
You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink
There's no place like home
Birds of a feather flock together
Absence makes the heart grow fonder
The early bird catches the worm
You reap what you sow
Loose lips sink ships
When the going gets tough, the tough get going
An apple a day keeps the doctor away
You can't have your cake and eat it too
Hindsight is 20/20
The grass is always greener on the other side
Rome wasn’t built in a day
You can’t judge a book by its cover
What goes around comes around
Two wrongs don’t make a right
Don’t put all your eggs in one basket
There’s no such thing as a free lunch
Don’t cry over spilled milk
The bigger they are, the harder they fall
The road to hell is paved with good intentions
Don't judge a man until you've walked a mile in his shoes
A house divided against itself cannot stand
If you play with fire, you'll get burned
You can’t make an omelet without breaking a few eggs
No pain, no gain
It’s not over till the fat lady sings
The devil is in the details
Never put off until tomorrow what you can do today
He who hesitates is lost
Many hands make light work
Easier said than done
What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger
Let sleeping dogs lie
Actions have consequences
Fortune favors the bold
A chain is only as strong as its weakest link
It takes two to tango
Don’t put the cart before the horse
Live and let live
A picture is worth a thousand words
You can’t teach an old dog new tricks
Never look a gift horse in the mouth
A little knowledge is a dangerous thing
If wishes were horses, beggars would ride
There's more than one way to skin a cat
The best defense is a good offense
A rising tide lifts all boats
Don't burn your bridges behind you
A jack of all trades is a master of none
If you lie down with dogs, you’ll get up with fleas
A leopard can’t change its spots
You can’t squeeze blood from a turnip
To each his own
Measure twice, cut once
The apple doesn’t fall far from the tree
When life gives you lemons, make lemonade
A soft answer turns away wrath
Don’t judge a day by the harvest you reap but by the seeds you plant
A word to the wise is sufficient
A barking dog never bites
You can’t have everything and eat it too
It’s darkest before the dawn
Clothes do not make the man
Clothes make the man
Nothing ventured, nothing gained
He who laughs last, laughs best
A dollar short and a day late
Do unto others as you would have them do unto you
An idle mind is the devil’s workshop
There’s no place like home
The more things change, the more they stay the same
Don't sweat the small stuff
A broken clock is right twice a day
The cobbler’s children have no shoes
A man is known by the company he keeps
A hungry man is an angry man
Every dog has its day
Failing to plan is planning to fail
One step at a time
Don’t make a mountain out of a molehill
A clear conscience is a soft pillow
Cut your coat according to your cloth
Be careful what you wish for; you just might get it
A promise is a debt
Don’t poke the bear
Even a blind squirrel finds a nut sometimes
Hard work beats talent when talent doesn’t work hard
A ship in the harbor is safe, but that’s not what ships are for
He who sleeps with dogs wakes up with fleas
The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago; the second-best time is now
No use crying over spilt milk
You made your bed, now lie in it
If you can’t stand the heat, get out of the kitchen
You can’t take it with you
Make the best of a bad situation
Some things are better left unsaid
The nail that sticks out gets hammered down
Silence is golden
A wise man listens more than he speaks
The bigger the risk, the bigger the reward
A penny for your thoughts
Don't put off until tomorrow what you can do today
If you chase two rabbits, you’ll catch neither
What’s done in the dark will come to light
Waste not, want not
The proof is in the pudding
Don't bite off more than you can chew
Some people are penny wise and pound foolish
Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die
The cream always rises to the top
The harder the struggle, the greater the reward
The best revenge is living well
The devil finds work for idle hands
A watched clock never moves
A fool speaks, a wise man listens
Marry in haste, repent at leisure
A little progress each day adds up to big results
If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again
The road to success is always under construction
Every rose has its thorn
You never miss the water till the well runs dry
What you don’t know can’t hurt you
Don't let the tail wag the dog
No guts, no glory
A bad workman blames his tools
A lazy man works twice
The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step
The past is a foreign country; they do things differently there
Blood is thicker than water
It takes a village to raise a child
The more you learn, the more you earn
Don’t stir the pot if you don’t want a mess
Good fences make good neighbors
The squeaky wheel gets replaced
If the shoe fits, wear it
A house is not a home
Do what you love, and you’ll never work a day in your life
The road to success is paved with failure
When you assume, you make a fool out of you and me
Some people talk the talk, but don’t walk the walk
Never speak ill of the dead
Don't rock the boat
A little bird told me
Every end is a new beginning
When one door closes, another opens
Don’t cross the bridge till you come to it
Don’t judge a man by his pocketbook
He who dares, wins
Not everything that glitters is gold
The chicken came before the egg
The past is prologue
It’s better to be safe than sorry
Talk is cheap
It’s better to give than to receive
If you don’t use it, you lose it
Good things don’t come easy
The customer is always right
Don’t judge a man by his handshake alone
What the heart wants, the heart wants
The best-laid plans often go awry
Experience is the best teacher
