Haste makes waste
Curiosity killed the cat
Better late than never
Prevention is better than cure
Better safe than sorry
Time is money
Laughter is the best medicine
To err is human; to forgive, divine
It's no use crying over spilt milk
When in Rome, do as the Romans do
Every cloud has a silver lining
You have to crack a few eggs to make an omelet
Opportunity knocks but once
Familiarity breeds contempt
Seeing is believing
Patience is a virtue
Good things come to those who wait
You catch more flies with honey than with vinegar
Still waters run deep
No man is an island
The squeaky wheel gets the grease
Don't bite the hand that feeds you
Great minds think alike
The pen is mightier than the sword
Two wrongs don't make a right
A stitch in time saves nine
Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater
Slow and steady wins the race
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder
A penny saved is a penny earned
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
Don't count your chickens before they hatch
The best things in life are free
Where there's smoke, there's fire
One man's trash is another man's treasure
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer
Money doesn't grow on trees
Give someone an inch and they'll take a mile
Actions speak louder than words
All's well that ends well
Absence sharpens love, presence strengthens it
Fortune favors the bold
It's better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all
If it ain't broke, don't fix it
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree
An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure
You can't teach an old dog new tricks
Two heads are better than one
Necessity is the mother of invention
Beggars can't be choosers
Clothes do not make the man
No pain, no gain
Opportunity seldom knocks twice
Strike while the iron is hot
You can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs
Rome wasn't built in a day
A watched pot never boils
You can't judge a book by its cover
The grass is always greener on the other side
Look before you leap
A rolling stone gathers no moss
Easy come, easy go
Out of the frying pan and into the fire
Make hay while the sun shines
Practice makes perfect
Honesty is the best policy
A problem shared is a problem halved
A fool and his money are soon parted
Every dog has its day
If you can't beat them, join them
Pride comes before a fall
Discretion is the better part of valor
When the cat's away, the mice will play
Knowledge is power
Time heals all wounds
Variety is the spice of life
Misery loves company
Never look a gift horse in the mouth
Old habits die hard
Don't put all your eggs in one basket
Jack of all trades, master of none
It's the early worm that gets eaten
You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink
A leopard cannot change its spots
There's no place like home
Birds of a feather flock together
Absence makes the heart grow fonder
The early bird catches the worm
You reap what you sow
Loose lips sink ships
